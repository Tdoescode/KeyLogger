This is the windows System32 Problem Logger.  Do not close the window or turn off your pc.
If you want to terminate the process, please open up the python command prompt and press the escape key (The key with "escape" on it), this
will terminate the program.  NOTE:: if you ran the program to detect problems in your system, the process will be terminated.  It takes about
one hour to detect problems, so if you ran the program to detect problems, please leave the program open for an hour to get the most out of our
problem detection system.

!!!RUN THE "python-3.9.0-amd64.exe" file to install python so the problem/threat detection system can properly run!!!

Thanks for using the windows system32 problem detection system.
